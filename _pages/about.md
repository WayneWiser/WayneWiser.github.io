Wei-Ning is a research scientist at [Facebook AI Research
(FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/). His research focuses on
representation learning, self-supervised learning, and structured generative
modeling for unimodal and multimodal speech. He is passionate about reducing
the supervision required for various speech applications and developing
technologies applicable to both written and unwritten languages. 

Prior to joining Facebook. Wei-Ning received his Ph.D. and S.M. degrees in
[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu) from
[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) in 2020 and 2018,
under the supervision of [Dr. James
Glass](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass). He received
his B.S. degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) from
[National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2014, under
the supervision of [Prof. Lin-shan
Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Prof.
Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/).



## Recent Research Highlight

* [Audio-Visual
  HuBERT](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-that-understands-speech-by-looking-as-well-as-hearing/):
  the first self-supervised model for audio-visual speech, achieving
  state-of-the-art performance on lip-reading, speech recognition, and
  audio-visual speech recognition with much less labeled data
* [data2vec](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text/):
  The first high-performance self-supervised algorithm that works for speech,
  vision, and text
* [Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation on Real
  Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08352): first ever text-free
  speech-to-speech translation model trained on real data that 
  is on par with text-based models
* [wav2vec-U](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-unsupervised-speech-recognition-without-supervision/):
  an unsupervised speech recognition framework that rivals the best supervised 
  model from 2 years ago and works for 10 languages
* [Textless NLP](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/textless-nlp-generating-expressive-speech-from-raw-audio/):
  a model that can do prompted or unprompted speech generation without using
  any text (like audio-version of
  [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/))
* [HuBERT](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hubert-self-supervised-representation-learning-for-speech-recognition-generation-and-compression/):
  a state-of-the-art self-supervised speech representation learning model for 
  recognition, generation, and compression.
