Quandong is a senior algorithm engineer and also a researcher at Speech Group, Xiaomi AI Lab. 
His research focuses on
multi-channel / end-to-end speech recognition, speech enhancement, speech separation, and multimodal modeling.
He is passionate about advancing far-field speech processing technologies and solving key problems. 
He has a vision of opening the door to the ultimate natural voice experience in the era of the Internet of Things, 
where there would not exist any obstacles to human-machine and human-human communication.

Prior to joining Xiaomi, Quandong received his Ph.D. degrees in
Signal and Information Proccessing from Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences / University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019.
During the Ph.D. period, he was also a joint training Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology
under the supervision of [Prof. Chin-Hui Lee](https://chl.ece.gatech.edu/). He received
his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from
Harbin Engineering University in 2014.
